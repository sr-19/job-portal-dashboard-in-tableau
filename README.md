# Job Portal Dashboard in Tableau

This is a project in which a 'Job Portal' dashboard is created using 'Tableau' to depict job postings, company information, and hiring trends. The dashboard is deployed on a website and served on Netlify, which makes it easier to access.

The dataset [file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset) contains job description data like job title, job role, date posted, requirements, company size, remuneration, and job preference. Filtering and data processing was done so that it led to efficient visualizations.

Here are the list of visualisations made and combined in a dashboard -
1. Companies Across Job Portals - Visual representation of job opportunities by various companies on various job websites.

2. Top 10 Jobs to Find Data Science and Engineering - Reveals top spots with most job listings for Data Scientists and for Data-focused Engineers, sorted by location, credentials and more. Looks like the red carpet, not only the firms hiring but also location where individuals want to get hired for jobs in those fields and top roles.

3. Company vs. Company Size - Compares companies by company size, organized by job category, experience, salary, employment type, and gender preference.
